                        <h3>Overview</h3>
                                Let me take you through our senior project adventure. First of all, I am thankful to have been grouped with two
                                amazing students, Chris Miller and Archan Rupela who are the epitome of fun and reliability. This project
                                which we call Task Management System or TMS was developed to support Sea Discovery Center public aquarium 
                                located in Poulsbo. The Sea Discovery Center is a public aquarium built to educate its community about marine life
                                and its environment. Our mission as a group is to create a tool that would help the aquarium personnel maintain 
                                the water conditions in the tanks.                                
                                <br><br>
                            <h3>Task</h3>
                                To create a monitoring system with a built-in alert notification manager. 
                                <br><br>
                            <h3>How does it work (high-level)</h3>
                                It starts from retrieving data from the pi sensors (hardware) that are hooked up in each tanks in the aquarium. 
                                Based on these data, we assign different status such as 'good', critical' or 'no data' according to its respective
                                water tank conditions. Conditions are based on whether the water temperature is too hot or too 
                                cold for the type of fish that live in the tank. Once the system detects a temperature that is tagged as 'critical'
                                the system must send an alert notification through email and a text message to the personnel at the Sea Discover
                                to perform appropriate action and mostly save the fish from imminent death. <br>

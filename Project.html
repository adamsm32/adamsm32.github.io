                        <h3>Overview</h3>
                                Let me take you through our year long senior project adventure. First of all, I am thankful to have been grouped with two
                                amazing students, Chris Miller and Archan Rupela who are the epitome of fun and reliability. This project
                                which we call Task Management System or TMS was developed to support Sea Discovery Center public aquarium 
                                located in Poulsbo. The <a href="https://sea.wwu.edu/ " target="_blank"> Sea Discovery Center </a>is a public aquarium built to educate its community about marine life
                                and its environment. Our mission as a group is to create a tool that would help the aquarium personnel maintain 
                                the water conditions in the tanks.                                
                                <br><br>
                            <h3>Task</h3>
                                To create a monitoring system with a built-in alert notification manager. 
                                <br><br>
                            <h3>How does it work (high-level)</h3>
                                It starts from retrieving data from the pi sensors (hardware) that are hooked up in each tanks in the aquarium. 
                                Based on these data, we assign different status such as 'good', critical' or 'no data' according to its respective
                                water tank conditions. Conditions are based on whether the water temperature is too hot or too 
                                cold for the type of fish that live in the tank. Once the system detects a temperature that is tagged as 'critical'
                                the system must send an alert notification through email and a text message to the personnel at the Sea Discover
                                to perform appropriate action and mostly save the fish from imminent death. <br>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Broadcast </li>
                                    Automated email that is sent directly to the personnel whose email address is registered to the system to
                                    notify about a critical reading detected or received during active monitoring process.  
                                    <li>Sound Alert</li>   
                                    An audible sound that is triggered when a critical status has been detected. This is directly experienced 
                                    through the desktop application installed.

                        <h3>Tools and Implementation</h3>   
                                Just like cooking, we need to prepare the tools we will use to implement this software. Let me break
                                down the implementation into three chunks: UI, framework, and back-end. First, we used Swing GUI toolkit 
                                to build each component in the UI, which include the login page and dashboard page. Consequently, we used MVC
                                or Model-view-controller framework to allow separation of components coupled with OOP. We were able to independently
                                work on each module that we assigned ourselves with allowing minimal effect on the overall program. 
                                Our teammate from Poulsbo, Josh, helped us set up a web server where we could scrape the pi-sensor data directly from the cyber range.
                                A python script using beautiful soup library was used to pull the data from the server. Lastly, back-end integration started as soon
                                as the data retrieval has been established and both features have been successfully implemented. A python script using smpt library
                                is used for SMPT protocol to perform the emailing process. We developed the program in intelliJ utilizing JDK and its standard libraries.

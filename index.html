					<li>Profile</li>
						<p >Family. School. Technology. My life has been about those three. When im not at school, 
							I'm spending time with my husband and my beautiful daughter. We like eating out, watching
							movies, playing tennis, hiking in the summer, and hanging out with in-laws or cousins. The rest of the time, 
							I'm on my computer either coding, designing or learning new technology frameworks. I like to put things in order. 
							I love meditation. I believe things executed with love and care always turn out beautifully.  </p>

					<li>Education</li>
						<p class="education">I am currently attending graduate school at Western Washington University for an MBA. 
							I ended up completing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science with minors in Mathematics and Business Administration.
							During undergrad, I discovered that Computer Science, while it's mostly about problem-solving and math,
							it is also about collaboration, independence, and resilience. Woah, big words there!
							This course taught me some major invaluable lessons in life. Here are the top four lessons I've learned:  Number one, 
							mistakes are inevitable--what matters is the corrected version of those mistakes. Number Two, things don't 
							always work out, and that is okay. Number three, working with other people can only help us grow--there is always 
							something to learn from collaboration. Last but not least, that function isn't going to code itself. 
							Doing is not the same as watching. We have to get ourselves dirty and practice. Try to find joy in whatever
							it is that you're doing. More changes to come...
						</p>

					<li>Career</li>
							 <p class="career"> Aside from five years of experience in sales and customer service industries, I've
								 established a three year exposure as a coordinator and a hiring manager for a start-up recruitment
								 company. My daily routine for this role revolved around hiring, coordinating targets with team leads,  
								 synching up tech concerns with the dev team, managing payroll, and coordinating output to clients.
								 All done remotely. I'm currently working on project management skills and in the market for 
								 software development oriented roles.
							 </p>

					<li>Mission</li>
						<p class="mission">Modeling competence, empowering ideas and connecting people through technology.</p>

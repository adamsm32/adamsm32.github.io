					<li>Profile</li>
						<p > Family. School. Technology. That's what I've been up to for the last half a dacade.
							When im not at school, I'm spending time with my husband and my beautiful daughter. We watch
							movies at home, play tennis, hike in the summer, and hang out with in-laws or cousins. The rest of the time, 
							I'm on my computer either coding, designing or learning new technology frameworks. I like to put things in order. 
							I believe things executed with love and care always turn out beautifully. 
						
							 </p>
					<li>Education</li>
						<p class="education">I am currently attending graduate school as an MBA candidate at Western Washington University. 
							My background started in accountancy, but by some miracle, I ended up completing a bachelor's degree in Computer 
							Science with minors in Mathematics and Business Administration. Wait a minute. No, it's not a miracle. I worked 
							hard and earned it! During my time as an undergrad, I discovered that Computer Science isn't only about problem-solving 
							and math-it is about collaboration, independence, and resilience. Woah, big words there! This course taught me 
							some major invaluable lessons in life. One, mistakes are inevitable. What matters is the corrected version 
							of those mistakes. Two, things don't always work out, and that is okay. Three, people need people. Whether 
							it's good or bad, there is always something to learn from working with other people. Last but not least, 
							that function isn't going to code itself. Doing is not the same as watching. We have to get ourselves dirty and practice.

					<li>Career</li>
							 <p class="career">My career started in Sales at age 18. Two years later, I became a customer relations specialist,
								  which lasted three years. So, I got five total years in the Sales and Customer Service industries. 
								  During these years, I learned the concept of performance, quality, and incentives. 								
								  A year later, I started working as a personal assistant in a recruitment start-up setup remotely. 
								  Not long until my role(s) for this job had expanded. I became a runner, the point of contact, 
								  the free safety, the one who's all over the place overseeing every aspect of the business. My daily norm revolved 
								  around hiring, coordinating targets with team leads,  synching up tech concerns with the dev team, 
								  and coordinating output to clients. This job lasted three years. Patience is the number one thing I learned from this job. 
								  I'm currently in the market for a semi-familiar role, Project management. Only this time, with a software development team.
							 </p>

					<li > Mission</li>
						<p class="mission">Modelling, empowering and showing the world that no matter how big, or complicated
								a job may seem, it can be done.</p>

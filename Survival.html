                        <h3>Overview</h3>
                               I have a lot to say about this game. Let me begin by saying game programming is my favorite part in my CS undergrad. 
                               I thought game programming was going to be tough and it was, to some degree, but it wasn't as bad as I thought. 
                               Survival Island is a cast-away inspired game Enya, Will and I developed in Unity engine. The story was about a plane
                               crash survivor and his or her journey to get off the island. To get off the island, the survivor needs to find the radio. 
                               The survivor will eventually discover elements in the island that would either help him find the radio, or prevent him
                               from getting the radio. There are 3 levels, at each level, the survivor must retrieve the items necessary to stay
                               alive and allow him to move on to the next level. The last level is the boss level. This level is a stealth level.
                               The survivor's goal is to steel the radio without being caught by the 'big guy'.

                            <h3>Task </h3>
                                To create a 3D, 3-level third person game in Unity utilizing animation, AI, game concept, game design and technical documentation
                                <br><br>
                            <h3>The game concept and the design </h3> 
                                <p>I can't fit all of it in this page I will just point out the major elements of the concept and design. </p>

                                <h4>The player, UI, and environment:</h4>   The player controls the main character who is the plane-crash survivor.
                                           The character emulates basic walking, running, crouching and picking up items.
                                            The player is allowed to assign any name on the character.
